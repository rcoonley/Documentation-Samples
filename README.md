This repository contains my technical writing samples.

## Online Help

[Database Software Help](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d4b301a7bed1ca78?p=1858691676559450112)
I wrote about 2,000 webpages of online help for the FileMaker 10 database software product.

## REST API Documentation 

[Cloud Servers API Documentation](https://github.com/rcoonley/Documentation-Samples/blob/main/Cloud%2520Servers%2520API%2520doc.md)
I initially created this Cloud Servers API documentation in XML with DITA and uploaded it to the product website. Because I no longer have access to the file files, I recreated it using Markdown. It is an incomplete draft at the moment.

## Quick Start for Cloud Container Software
*Coming soon!*
