I wrote about 2,000 webpages of online help for the FileMaker 10 Pro/Advanced database software product. Help topics included how to create databases, share data, use scripts and functions, and more. 

## REST API Documentation 

[Cloud Servers API Documentation](https://github.com/rcoonley/Documentation-Samples/blob/a289cb8138ad890149a41a00822e1d7f40f39af5/Cloud%20Servers%20API%20doc.md)

I initially created this Cloud Servers API documentation in XML with DITA and uploaded it to the product website. Because I no longer have access to the file files, I recreated it using Markdown. It is an incomplete draft at the moment.

## Training Documents
