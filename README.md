# Documentation-Samples
This repository contains some of my technical writing samples.

## Online Help

[Database Software Help](https://help.claris.com/archive/help/10/fmp/en/index.html)

I wrote about 2,000 webpages of online help for the FileMaker 10 Pro/Advanced database software product. Help topics included how to create databases, share data, use scripts and functions, and more. 

## REST API Documentation 

[Cloud Servers API Documentation](https://github.com/rcoonley/Documentation-Samples/blob/a289cb8138ad890149a41a00822e1d7f40f39af5/Cloud%20Servers%20API%20doc.md)

I initially created this Cloud Servers API documentation in XML with DITA and uploaded it to the product website. Because I no longer have access to the files, I recreated it using Markdown. It is an incomplete draft at the moment.

## Training Documents

[End-User Training Presentation for Kubernetes](https://docs.google.com/file/d/1iuIjJDi0PmgsWO8CDF4zJLv8n7ydClNY/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=mspresentation)

In Google Slides (similar to Adobe PowerPoint), I created this training presentation for Getting Started with Kubernetes.  

## Quick Start for Cloud Container Software

 *Link coming soon.*
 
I had cloud computing knowledge, but quickly learned cloud container software (Docker and Kubernetes) and created this user guide within two weeks for Rancher's cloud container software product. I wrote it in Markdown in GitHub.

## Software Evaluation Guide for Cloud Container Software & Edge Hardware

 *Link coming soon.*
 
I created this Siemens user guide to help developers try out the new global portal. It walks users through installing Kubernetes Edge IoT Core appliance software, onboarding devices, creating a single-node cluster, and installing a Local Portal app and System apps. Note that this is a draft and not the final version.
