# Quick Start Guide for Using Kubernetes in Rancher
---

In this guide, you'll learn how to quickly get started using Kubernetes in Rancher v1.6, including:

* Preparing a Linux Host
* Launching Rancher Server (and Accessing the Rancher UI)
* Creating a Kubernetes Environment in Rancher
* Adding Hosts
* Adding Containers
* Launching Catalog Applications

## Preparing a Linux Host

To begin, you'll need to install a [supported version of Docker]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/{{page.version}}/{{page.lang}}/setup/#supported-docker-versions) on a single Linux host. You can use your laptop, a virtual machine, or a physical server.

>**Note:** The versions of Docker that Rancher supports can differ from those that Kubernetes supports. In addition, Rancher does not currently support Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac.

### To Prepare a Linux Host:

1. Prepare a Linux host with 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04, at least **1GB** of memory, and a kernel of 3.10+.
2. Install a [supported version of Docker]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/{{page.version}}/{{page.lang}}/hosts/#supported-docker-versions) on the host. To install Docker on the server, follow the instructions from [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/).

## Launching Rancher Server

It only takes one command and a few minutes to install and launch Rancher Server. Once installed, you can open a web browser to access the Rancher UI.

> **Note:** We recommend configuring [access control](http://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v1.6/en/configuration/access-control/). Otherwise, your UI and API is available to anyone who can access your IP address.

### To Launch Rancher Server:

1. Run this Docker command on your host:

   ```bash
   $ sudo docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 rancher/server:stable
   # Tail the logs to show Rancher
   $ sudo docker logs -f <CONTAINER_ID>
   ```

   After launching the container, we'll tail the logs of the container to see when the server is up and running. When the Rancher UI is ready, a `Startup Succeeded, Listening on port` message displays. This process might take several minutes to complete.

2. To access the Rancher UI, go to `http://<SERVER_IP>:8080`, replacing `<SERVER_IP>` with the IP address of your host. The UI displays a Welcome to Rancher message.

   > **Note:** If you are running your browser on the same host running Rancher Server, you will need to use the hostâ€™s real IP address, such as `http://192.168.1.100:8080,` and not `http://localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
   
3. Click **Got It**. The Rancher UI displays.

## Creating a Kubernetes Environment in Rancher

Rancher supports grouping resources into multiple [environments]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/{{page.version}}/{{page.lang}}/concepts/environments/). Each environment starts with an [environment template]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/{{page.version}}/{{page.lang}}/concepts/environment-template) to define its set of [infrastructure services]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/{{page.version}}/{{page.lang}}/concepts/infra-services/), and one or more users or groups own it.

Initially, Rancher creates a **Default** Cattle environment for you. To deploy Kubernetes in Rancher, we'll use the pre-defined Kubernetes environment template and then add the environment to Rancher.

### To Create a Kubernetes Environment in Rancher:

1. From the **Environment** menu, select **Manage Environments**.
2. Click **Add Environment**, enter a **Name** (required) and a **Description** (optional).
3. Select the Kubernetes template, and then click **Create**.
4. From the **Environment** menu, select your Kubernetes environment. A `Setting up Kubernetes` message displays and prompts you to add at least one host.

You can access this new environment from the **Environment** menu. If you configured access control, you can add members to this environment and select their membership roles on the **Manage Environments** page.

## Adding Hosts

The process of adding hosts is the same steps for all container orchestration types, including Cattle and Kubernetes. For Kubernetes, adding your first host deploys infrastructure services, including Kubernetes services like master, kubelet, etcd, and proxy. You can see the progress of the deployment by accessing the **Kubernetes > Infrastructure Stacks** menu.

You can either add a custom host or a host from a cloud provider that Rancher v1.6 supports. If you don't see your cloud provider in the UI, don't worry. Simply use the `Custom` host option, which is selected by default. It provides the Docker command to launch the Rancher agent container. Rancher uses Docker Machine to launch hosts for the other cloud providers.

Hosts you plan to use as Kubernetes nodes require the following TCP ports open for `kubectl`: `10250` and `10255`.

If you're adding a custom host, note these requirements:

* Typically, Rancher automatically detects the IP address to register the host.
  * If the host is behind a NAT or the same machine that is running the `rancher/server` container, you might need to explicitly specify its IP address.
* The host agent initiates a connection to the server, so make sure firewalls or security groups allow it to reach the URL in the command.
* All hosts in the environment must to allow traffic between each other for cross-host networking.
  * IPSec: `500/udp` and `4500/udp`
  * VXLAN: `4789/udp`

### To Add a Custom Host:

1. From the **Infrastructure** menu, select **Hosts**. The Hosts page displays.
2. Click **Add Host**.
3. Enter your **Host Registration URL**, and click **Save**. This URL is where Rancher Server is running, and it must be reachable from any hosts you add. The Add Host page displays.
4. Select **Custom**.
5. If you need to specify the agent IP address, you can enter it in the field.
6. To register your host with Rancher, copy the Docker command from the UI and then run it on your host. This process might take a few minutes to complete. For example:

   ```bash
   sudo docker run --rm --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /var/lib/rancher:/var/lib/rancher rancher/agent:v1.6
   http://<SERVER_IP>:8080/v3/scripts/D5433C26EC51325F9D98:1483142400000:KvILQKwz1N2MpOkOiIvGYKKGdE
   ```

   >**Note:** The IP address in the command must match your `<SERVER_IP>` and it must be reachable from inside your host.

7. Click **Close**. On the Hosts page, you can view the status of your host.

### To Add a Host from a Cloud Provider:

1. From the **Infrastructure** menu, select **Hosts**. The Hosts page displays.
2. Click **Add Host**.
3. Enter your **Host Registration URL**, and click **Save**. This URL is where Rancher Server is running, and it must be reachable from any hosts you add. The Add Host page displays.
4. Select your cloud provider:
   * Amazon EC2
   * Microsoft Azure
   * DigitalOcean
   * Packet
   * Other

5. Follow the instructions in the Rancher UI to add your host. This process might take a few minutes to complete. Once your host is ready, you can view its status on the Hosts page.

After you add at least one host to your environment, it might take several minutes for all Rancher system services to launch. To verify the status of your environment, from the **Kubernetes** menu, select **Infrastructure Stacks**. If a service is healthy, its state displays in green.

### Adding Containers

Once you've verified that all system services are up and running, you're ready to create your first container. In Kubernetes, one or more containers is a `pod`.

The process for adding a container differs depending on your container orchestration type. The Rancher UI provides three options for using Kubernetes: Dashboard, CLI, and `kubectl`. Please refer to Kubernetes' [Overview of kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) for more details.

### To Add a Container:

From the **Kubernetes** menu, select one of the following options:

   * **Dashboard** -  Access the native Kubernetes dashboard in a new browser window by clicking **Kubernetes UI**.
   * **CLI** - On the Kubernetes CLI page, two options display. To configure `kubectl` for your local machine, click **Generate Config**. Copy and paste the code that displays into your `.kube/config` file, and then run `kubectl`. You can also conveniently access the shell in a managed `kubectl` instance right in your web browser.

### Launching Catalog Applications

To help you deploy complex stacks, the Rancher Catalog offers application templates.

### To Launch a Catalog Application:

1. From the **Kubernetes** menu, select **Infrastructure Stacks**.
2. Click **Add from Catalog**. Catalog application templates display.
2. Search for the template you want to launch, and then click **View Details**.
3. Select a **Template Version**. The latest version displays by default.
4. Enter a **Name** (required) and **Description** (optional) for your template.   
5. Enter the **Configuration Options**, which are specific to the template.

   >**Note:** To review the `docker-compose.yml` and `rancher-compose.yml` files used to generate the stacks, click **Preview** before launching the stack.

6. Select **Start services after creating**, if applicable.
7. Click **Launch**. On the Stack page, you'll see Rancher is creating a stack based on your new application. This process might take a few minutes.

Once your new stack's services are up and running, its state displays in green.
